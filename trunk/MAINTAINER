Re-package
==========

  Before re-package source tarball, one has to update the version number 
  in file 'Makefile' line:

    VER = [NEW_VERSION]

  It is highly recommended that file 'ChangeLog' should be updated to reflect
  changes.

  Change into directory liberation-fonts-[VERSION]/ and re-package as 
  distribution by following commands:

    $ cd liberation-fonts-[VERSION]
    $ make dist

  A new package will be generated as 'liberation-fonts-[NEW_VERSION].tar.gz'.
