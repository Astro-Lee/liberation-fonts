To Maintainers
==============

Please see the README before continuing.

Before packaging a new release based on a new source tarball, you have to
update the version number in the Makefile:
VER = [VERSION]

Make sure that the defined version corresponds to the font software metadata
which you can check with ftinfo/otfinfo or fontforge itself.
It is highly recommended that file 'ChangeLog' is updated to reflect
changes.

Create a tarball with the following command:
$ make dist

The new versionned tarball will be available in the dist/ folder as
'liberation-fonts-[NEW_VERSION].tar.gz'.
