1. What's this?
===============

liberation-fonts is fonts to replace commonly used Microsoft Windows Fonts.

The Liberation Fonts are intended to be replacements for the three most 
commonly used fonts on Microsoft systems: Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier 
New.


2. Requirements
===============

  * fontforge.
    - http://fontforge.sourceforge.net


3. Install
==========

3.1 Decompress tarball

  You can extract the files by following command:

    $ tar zxvf liberation-fonts-[VERSION].tar.gz

3.2 Build from the source

  Change into directory liberation-fonts-[VERSION]/ and build from sources by 
  following commands:

    $ cd liberation-fonts-[VERSION]
    $ make build

  The built font files will be stored in 'build' directory.

3.3 Install to system

  Install to system by following command:

    $ make install


4. Usage
========

The fonts should be installed and detected by the system after installation. 
User is adviced to restart system to ensure fonts are ready to be used.


5. Re-package
=============

  Before re-package source tarball, one has to update the version number 
  in file 'Makefile' line:

    VER = [NEW_VERSION]

  It is highly recommended that file 'ChangeLog' should be updated to reflect
  changes.

  Change into directory liberation-fonts-[VERSION]/ and re-package as 
  distribution by following commands:

    $ cd liberation-fonts-[VERSION]
    $ make dist

  A new package will be generated as 'liberation-fonts-[NEW_VERSION].tar.gz'.


6. License
==========

The license of the Liberation Fonts is a EULA that contains GPLv2 and two 
exceptions:

  The first exception is the standard FSF font exception.

  The second exception is an anti-lockdown clause somewhat like the one in 
  GPLv3. This license is Free, but GPLv2 and GPLv3 incompatible.

Read GPLV2 file 'COPYING' and Liberation Fonts License file 'License.txt' for
more information.
