1. What's this?
===============

The Liberation Fonts are intended to be open font replacements for the three
most commonly used fonts on Microsoft systems: Times New Roman, Arial, and
Courier New.


2. Requirements
===============

  * fontforge.
    - http://fontforge.sourceforge.net


3. Install
==========

3.1 Decompress tarball

  You can extract the files by following command:

    $ tar zxvf liberation-fonts-[VERSION].tar.gz

3.2 Build from the source

  Change into directory liberation-fonts-[VERSION]/ and build from sources by 
  following commands:

    $ cd liberation-fonts-[VERSION]
    $ make

  The built font files will be available in 'build' directory.

3.3 Install to system

  You can manually install the fonts by copying them to ~/.fonts for a
  particular user, or to /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation for system-wide
  availability


4. Usage
========

The fonts should be installed and detected by the system after installation. 


5. License
==========

Read the GPL v2 file 'COPYING' and the Liberation Fonts EULA file 'License.txt'
for more information.

 Supplement Information to Maintainers
=======================================

    README covers general information.

    Before packaging a new release based on a new source tarball, you have to
    update the version number in the Makefile:

    VER = [VERSION]

    Make sure that the defined version corresponds to the font software metadata
which you can check with ftinfo/otfinfo or fontforge itself. It is highly recommended that file 'ChangeLog' is updated to reflect
changes.

Create a tarball with the following command:
$ make dist

The new versionned tarball will be available in the dist/ folder as
'liberation-fonts-[NEW_VERSION].tar.gz'.
