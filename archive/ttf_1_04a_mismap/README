This is fontforge modified version TTF files from original Ascender's latest 
TTF (1.03) which consists of the following differences:

Ignored DSIG and VDMX table 
===========================

Due to the current fontforge could not preserve the DSIG and VDMX table in 
original TTF files from Ascender, they are not included in these fontforge 
generated TTF files. Hence, original TTF files are kept available in case when 
solutions are available in future.

According to Ascender, DSIG table is digital signature which generally does not 
affect glyph data. However, exclusion of VDMX table might results differences 
on glyphs. This is still in inspection at the moment.

Fixed Unicode Name Mapping Inaccuracy
=====================================

Fontforge reported that there are Unicode names mapped to inaccurately. 
According to Ascender, the Unicode names is not applicable except by postscript
format. The fix is still included in this version.
